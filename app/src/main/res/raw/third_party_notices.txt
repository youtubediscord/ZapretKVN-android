- Pinned commit: `ff11f007ec798136a5de258f947a4f34011a37ea`
- License: GNU General Public License version 3 or later.
- Copyright: 2022 nekohasekai and contributors.

Pinned source additionally states that no derivative work may use the name of, or imply association with, the original application without prior consent. Zapret KVN uses its own name and identity.

Release artifacts must include corresponding source/build instructions required by the license.
The exact pinned license text, including the additional naming condition, is
also retained as an application raw resource and as a CI core artifact.

## SagerNet sing-geoip rule-set

- Source: <https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-geoip>
- Binary snapshot: `5605651c12ed5b2fcf3b5de580c041eb9d8d938e`
- License of the generator: GNU General Public License version 3 or later.

The APK contains only the pinned RU IP binary rule-set. Its SHA-256 and source
URL are recorded in `app/src/main/assets/rule-sets/manifest.json`; the upstream
license is retained as `app/src/main/res/raw/sing_geoip_license.txt`.

The generated `libbox.aar` also contains the Go modules resolved by the pinned
`go.mod` and `go.sum`. Their exact source versions are therefore reproducible
from the commit above. Their original copyright and license files remain in the
downloaded module sources under `core-build/gopath/pkg/mod`; release source
bundles must preserve them.

## AndroidX and Jetpack Compose

The app uses AndroidX Core, Activity, Compose UI, Foundation, Material icons and
Material 3. These components are distributed under the Apache License 2.0.
License resources supplied by these runtime libraries are not stripped from the
